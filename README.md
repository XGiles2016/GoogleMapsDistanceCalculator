# GoogleMapsDistanceCalculator
Distance calculator to determine distances to different cities and display them

As a recent college graduate, the job search is not easy. As I expand my search I am looking for both a city with opportunity and affordable living. With this tool, I can set my default city(the place where I plan on living) and the cities around with job opportunities. A simple job search shows me jobs from Boston, to framingham, to Waltham and multiple other cities. 

By setting my default city as Worcester, my current home town, I can use this tool to see the distances to all of these cities around me in one place instead of using Google Maps and searching the distance to each city, one by one. When I eventually move, maybe across the country, I can set my home town to San Diego and search different jobs around there and I'll know the distances before I even begin applying.

I plan on using this tool mostly as a means of limiting my job search and I plan on upgrading this tool to determine best cities to live in price wise, versus opportunity wise!

Feature List:
Enter cities and calculate distances to each

Upcoming Features(hopefully)
Determine best cities to live in - price vs. opportunity
Show housing options by linking to Craigslist, apartments.com, etc for each city
Show job listings by linking to Indeed.com, Monster.com, etc


As of now this is just a command line app, but an Android app is on the way!(again, hopefully)
